This is my solution to the project for day 1:  Working with Agile-style project
management and BDD(Behavior Driven Development).

I worked through the code rails book, solving each
problem one at a time.  My sources were basically
just the capybara readme on github as well as a few
answers on stackoverflow related to capybara syntax, for
example how to get the current path:
